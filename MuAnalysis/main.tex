\section{Structured uncertainty}
Dealing with \textbf{structured uncertainty} and the analysis of feedback control systems affected by it, we are going to consider the \textit{general control configuration} depicted in the figure below.
Here $z_\Delta$ and $w_\Delta$ are the so-called \textit{uncertainty channels}, which in turn are the signals connecting the \textbf{uncertainty sources} with the known part of the feedback control system. On the other hand the signals $z_p$ and $w_p$ are chosen in order to satisfy \textbf{performance requirements} from which the name \textbf{performance channel}. In the following we deal with mainly with \textbf{parametric uncertainty}.

        $P\Delta{G_c}$ \textsf{general structure}
    \end{center}
    

\noindent
In such a general structure the sources of uncertainty $\Delta_i$ are pulled out to form a \textbf{block diagonal matrix} $\Delta$, that is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Delta_blocks}
    \Delta=\text{diag}\{\Delta_i\}=\begin{bmatrix}
        \Delta_1&0&\dots&0\\
        0&\Delta_2&\dots&0\\
        \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
        0&\dots&0&\Delta_n
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
We will consider different sources of uncertainty (real, complex full mzatrix, real repeated real scalar values).
\end{multicols}

\subsection{Uncertainty sources}
In the analysis of stability and performances by using the $\mu$-analysis we will consider mainly:
\begin{itemize}
    \itemsep-0.2em
    \item \textbf{Real scalar} perturbations $\Delta_i\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $\vert \Delta_i \vert\le1$; 
    \item \textbf{Complex full matrix} perturbations $\Delta_i(s)\in\mathbb{C}^{m,m}$, $\Vert \Delta_i \Vert_\infty\le1$;
    \item \textbf{Repeated real scalar} perturbations $\Delta_i I_r$, where $I_r$ is an $r\times{r}$ identity matrix, and $\Delta_i\in\mathbb{R}$, $\Delta_i\le{1}$ 
\end{itemize}
In order to perform a computer-aided $\mu$-analysis, how we will see we use the command \texttt{mu} that among all of the parameters, take as input a matrix called \texttt{deltaset}. The main objective of such a matrix is \textit{describing the blocks of \Cref{eq:Delta_blocks}} ( the block diagonal matrix we mentioned) in term of: (i) type, (ii) dimensions, (iii) number of independent locations in which the uncertainty itself appears. By using a summarizing table, we mention the principal pattern we can find in analyzing our feedback control systems. 

\begin{table}[h!]

        \toprule[1pt]

        \midrule
        Scalar real parameter&$[-1\quad{1}]$ or $[-1\quad0]$\\

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{\texttt{deltaset} for describing $\Delta$}
    \label{tab:deltaset}
\end{table}
\noindent
Wheter in the feedback control system there are $U$ uncertainty sources the final matrix will be such that \texttt{deltaset} $\in\mathbb{R}^{U,2}$.
In the following sections we are going to do some examples which will clarify what is the structure of the \texttt{deltaset} matrix according to the structure of the uncertain plant $G_p(s)$.
The models can be considered for the uncertainty are the following, given the generic parameter $k$:

\end{table}


\subsection{Fundamental bricks for structured uncertainty}
Going on to analyze the structure of our uncertain system we can find in the transfer function some fundamental bricks that put all together will give us the description through block diagrams of the uncertain plant. \textsf{Some aspects are presented in details for the first example while they are not repeated for the following ones which are using exactly the same steps.}

\subsubsection{Real Pole in zpk form}

\subsubsection*{Example 1 (pole in the feedback path)}
Given the following transfer function for an uncertain plant 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ex1}
    G_p(s)=\frac{k}{s+p} \quad  
    \underline{k}\le {k} \le \overline{k}, \quad
    \underline{p}\le {p} \le \overline{p}
\end{equation}
we want to obtain its block diagram description. In particular for each parameter is required to obtain the central estimate $k_n$ and $p_n$ and the radius of uncertainty $W_k$ and $W_p$. Compute also the matrix $\Delta$ and the associated \texttt{deltaset} for the command \texttt{mu}.\\
The first step is for computing the value $k_n$, $p_n$, $W_k$ and $W_p$:
\begin{align}
    k_n=\frac{\underline{k}+\overline{k}}{2} \quad
    W_k=\frac{\overline{k}-\underline{k}}{2}, \qquad 
    p_n=\frac{\underline{p}+\overline{p}}{2} \quad
    W_p=\frac{\overline{p}-\underline{p}}{2}
\end{align}
\noindent
At the end of the day, we are likely to build such block diagrams in \textsc{Simulink}\footnote{
    Some algebraic manipulation are needed in order to avoid non proper blocks that -- for sure-- are going to raise an error during the simulation.
}, for this reason we have to manipulate the expression of \Cref{eq:ex1} in order to be able to represent them. If we put in evidence $s$ at the denominator we can write:

\begin{multicols}{2}
    {\large{
        \begin{equation*}
            G_p(s)=\frac{k}{s(1+\frac{p}{s})}=k \frac{\frac{1}{s}}{1+\frac{p}{s}}
        \end{equation*}
    }}
    The first term of the expression is simply a gain, while we can see the second term as a \textit{feedback configuration} with negative feedback.
    \newcolumn 
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{img/ex1.jpg}\\
        \textsf{Block diagram for \Cref{eq:ex1}}
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}

\noindent
\textsf{\large \textbf{Additive Uncertainty Set}}\\
If we use the as uncertainty set the \textit{additive one} the block diagram we have showed changes as follows: 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.23]{img/ex1_add.jpg}
    \caption{Block diagram of $G_p(s)$ (additive model)}
\end{figure}
\noindent
Note that we have only added the for the parameters the uncertain description as indicated in \Cref{tab:uncertainty_set}. With the objective of obtaining the the $P\Delta{G_c}$ structure we have to: (i) put such a diagram in the Feedback control System (FCS) scheme; (ii) pull out all of the $\Delta_i$ blocks; (iii) pull out the controller $G_c$. \\
More interesting is the construction of the matrix $\Delta$ and its describing matrix \texttt{deltaset}. For this aim is crucial that all of the uncertainty channels are properly numbered. The block diagram becomes the one in \Cref{fig:ex1_num}, where there are also the signals entering/coming from the (structured) uncertainty block $\Delta$. According to the numbering we use in the block diagram we have to insert the diagonal blocks into $\Delta$ as reported here:

\begin{equation}
    \Delta=\begin{bmatrix}
        {\color{red}{\Delta_k}}&0\\
        0&{\color{blue}{\Delta_p}}
    \end{bmatrix} \qquad
    \texttt{deltaset}=[
        \underbrace{\texttt{{\color{red}{-1,1}}}}_{\color{red}1}; 
        \underbrace{\texttt{{\color{blue}-1,1}}}_{\color{blue}2}]
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.23]{img/ex1_num.jpg}
    \caption{Block diagram of $G_p(s)$ (additive) with numbered sources}
    \label{fig:ex1_num}
\end{figure}


\noindent
The first block of $\Delta$ is the one related to the uncertain parameter $\color{red} k$, the second the one related to the uncertain parameter $\color{blue} p$. Let the colors guide you in the understanding the relationship existing between the block diagram and related $\Delta$ and \texttt{deltaset}.\\

\noindent
\textsf{\large \textbf{Multiplicative Uncertainty Set}}\\
Identical reasoning can be done, if we assume to take as model of uncertainty the \textit{multiplicative one}. Substituting in the general scheme, the structure for the uncertain parameters from the \Cref{tab:uncertainty_set}, the scheme in \Cref{fig:ex1_mul} is obtained. The associated matrix $\Delta$ and the \texttt{deltaset} array are the same as before.

\newpage
\subsubsection*{Example 2 (model the reciprocal of an uncertain parameter)}
Given the following plant
\begin{equation}
    G_p(s)=\frac{k}{1+s\tau}, \quad     
\end{equation}
is required to find a block diagram description of it, in a way that can be implemented in a simulink scheme. 
\begin{multicols}{2}
    \noindent
    A rearragement of the terms is needed: 
\begin{equation}
    G_p(s)=k \ \frac{\frac{1}{s}\cdot \frac{1}{\tau}}{1+\frac{1}{s\tau}}
\end{equation}
We omit the gain, to focus our attention on the second part of the transfer function.

\newcolumn
The second term can be represented as:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.13]{img/tau.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{multicols}


\noindent
The second term can be recasted in a basic feedback structure whose direct path has the block $1/{s\tau}$, simply 1 in the feedback path. But how can we draw the diagram for the inverse of the uncertain parameter? It depends from the type of uncertainty set. 

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \noindent
\textbf{\textsf{Multiplicative set}}\\
The term $1/\tau$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\tau}=\frac{1}{\tau_n}\cdot
    \frac{1}{1+W_\tau \Delta_\tau}
\end{equation}
The related block diagram representation is:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.13]{img/tau_mul.jpg}
\end{center}

\newcolumn
\noindent
\textbf{\textsf{Additive set}}\\
The term $1/\tau$ can be written as:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{\tau}=\frac{1}{\tau_n+W_\tau \Delta_\tau}=
    \frac{\frac{1}{\tau_n}}{1+\frac{W_\tau \Delta_\tau}{\tau_n}}
\end{equation}
The related block diagram representation is:
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.11]{img/tau_add.jpg}
\end{center}
\end{multicols}
\noindent
The remaining part of the discussion, about the port numbering and block $\Delta$ description, the way we retrieve $\Delta_\tau$ and $W_\tau$ does not change. This is the reason why we omit this part.
 
\subsubsection{Real pole in DC-gain form}
Here the objective is to analyze the block diagrams for the uncertain plant described by the following transfer function in \textit{DC-gain (or time constant) form}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ex2}
    G_p(s)=\frac{k}{1+\frac{s}{p}} \qquad
    \underline{k}\le {k} \le \overline{k}, \quad
    \underline{p}\le {p} \le \overline{p}
\end{equation}
\noindent

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \noindent
    Following the same path we algebrically manipulate the \Cref{eq:ex2} in order to obtain:
    \begin{equation*}
        G_p(s)=k \ \frac{\frac{p}{s}}{1+\frac{p}{s}}
    \end{equation*}
    \newcolumn
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.15]{img/ex2.jpg}
    \end{center}
\end{multicols}
\noindent
No other comments are needed  for modeling $p$ since it is a simple uncertain parameter whose modeling can follow the \Cref{tab:uncertainty_set}.


\subsubsection{Complex conjugate poles}
Given the following transfer function for an uncertain plant
\begin{equation}
    G_p(s)=\frac{k\omega_n^2}{s^2+2\zeta\omega_n{s}+\omega_n^2}\quad
    \underline{k}\le {k} \le \overline{k}, \quad
    \underline{\omega}_n\le {\omega_n} \le \overline{\omega}_n
\end{equation}
Here it is useful to apply the properties of the \textit{Laplace transform} in order to pass into a state-space description. In particular we know, by definition, that given a certain transfer function $G_p(s)$ it is defined as
\begin{align}
    &G_p(s)=\frac{y(s)}{u(s)} \iff y(s) (s^2+2\zeta\omega_n{s}+\omega_n^2)=u(s) \ k\omega_n^2 \iff \\
    &\frac{1}{\omega_n^2}\ddot{y}(t)+\frac{2\zeta}{\omega_n}\dot{y}(t)+y(t)=k{u(t)}\label{eq:diff_eq}
\end{align}
We can retrieve from the \textit{differential equation} \cref{eq:diff_eq} the state space description by introducing some state variables. In particular: 
\begin{align}
    x_1(t)=y(t) \quad
    x_2(t)=\dot{y}(t) \quad
\end{align}
Here we assume \textbf{zero initial conditions} so that we can write\footnote{
    Here the matrices of the state space description are: 
    \begin{equation*}
        A=\begin{bmatrix}
            0&1\\
            -\omega_n^2&-2\zeta\omega_n
        \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
        B=\begin{bmatrix}
            0\\
            k\omega_n^2
        \end{bmatrix}, \quad 
        C=[ 1 \quad 0]
    \end{equation*}
    Since they are not strictly necessary we put them here.
}:
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{cases}
        \dot{x_1}(t)=x_2(t)\\
        \dot{x_2}(t)=-2\zeta\omega_n{x_2}(t)-\omega_n^2{x_1}(t)+k\omega_n^2{u(t)}\\
        y=x_1
    \end{cases} \Longrightarrow \quad \begin{cases}
        \dot{x}(t)=Ax(t)+Bu(t)\\
        y(t)=Cx(t)
    \end{cases} 
\end{equation*}
In order to draw the block diagram we individuate the equation containing the $u(t)$ that is the input till reaching the output $y(t)$. The resulting block diagram is: 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{img/complex.jpg}
    \caption{Block diagram of $G_p(s)$}
\end{figure}
\newpage
\noindent
This is the general form of the transfer function containing the complex conjugate poles, the single parameters must be substituted with their own uncertain description using one of the uncertainty sets.\\
 This example is interesting since here there are repeated parameters, we can number with 1 the uncertainty related to the parameter $k$, 2 the uncertainty related to the damping factor $\zeta$, finally all the others are the uncertainty channels related to the natural frequency $\omega_n$. The resulting \texttt{deltaset} is
 
 \begin{equation}
    \texttt{deltaset}=[
        -1,0; \
        -1,0; \
        -5,0
    ]
 \end{equation}\\

\hrule
\vspace{0.3em}
\noindent
\textsf{The description obtained so far by using the state space description is quite general, so that we could consider also the case of \textbf{non-zero} initial conditions. Clearly also the previous example would have been provided us with the possibility to follow the same appproach, however when simple manipulations can be algebraically done by using directly the transfer function it is more convient and fast.}

\section{Robust stability with structured uncertainty}
At this stage, since the controller is known, we can collapse the blocks $P$ and $G_c$ in a single block which we call $N$. The structure we obtain can be called $N-\Delta$. In this context $N$ contains all the known parts of the feedback control system: the controller, actuators and nominal plant, the weighting functions accounting for the performance requiremens, The figure ...\\
This operation coincides with a \textit{upper linear fractional transformation (upper LFT)}, where we can write
\begin{equation}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        z_\Delta\\
        z_p
    \end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}
        N_{11}&N_{12}\\
        N_{12}&N_{22}
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        w_\Delta\\
        w_p
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
It can be prooved that ensuring robust stability for the $N-\Delta$ structure is equivalent to check that: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RS_cond}
    \det(I-N_{11}\Delta(j\omega))\ne0 \quad \forall \omega, \forall \Delta, \ \Vert \Delta \Vert_\infty<1
\end{equation}
where $N_{11}$ is the matrix tranfer function from $z_\Delta$ to $w_\Delta$.


\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.13]{img/NDelta.jpg}
    \caption{$N-\Delta$ structure}
\end{figure}


\section{Robust performance with structured stabiliy}
In the context of robust control, robust performance requirements can be expressed as: 
\begin{equation}
    \Vert F(s,\Delta) \Vert_\infty<1, \quad \forall\Delta, \quad
    z_p=F(s,\Delta)w_p
\end{equation}
where $F(s,\Delta)$ is a given matrix transfer function accounting for the performance requirements. Such a functional $F$ can be written as: 
\begin{equation}
    F(s,\Delta)=\bigg\Vert
        \begin{matrix}
            W_S S(s,\Delta)\\
            W_T T(s,\Delta)
        \end{matrix}
    \bigg\Vert 
\end{equation}
By using the properties of the LFT, can be shown that ensuring the robust performance in this case is equivalent to ensure the robust stability of the structure $N-\hat{\Delta}$ obtained by introducing a fictitious scalar complex uncertainty $\Delta_p$, which in turn is the same to require that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RP_cond}
    \det(I-N\Delta(j\omega))\ne 0 \quad \forall \omega, \forall \Delta
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.13]{img/NDeltahat.jpg}
    \caption{$N-\hat{\Delta}$ structure}
\end{figure}
Note that both conditions for robust stability and robust performance, come from the generalized Nyquist Criterion for MIMO systems.


\section{Structured singular value $\mu$}
The conditions in \Cref{eq:RS_cond} and \Cref{eq:RP_cond} we have just obtained are of little practical interest, since we cannot explore all the frequencies and all the uncertainties, just to prove that the system is robust! An alternative, more practical, approach is needed. In particular, it may be useful to start by substituing in the determinant expression a certain $\Delta$ and to decrement it gradually. In particular: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Checking Robust Stability} is equivalent to compute the \textit{smallest structured uncertainty} $\Delta$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
        \det(I-N_{11}\Delta(j\omega))=0, \forall \omega
    \end{equation}
    \item \textbf{Checking Robust Performance} is equivalent to find the \textit{smallest structured uncertainty $\hat{\Delta}$} such that the stability is destroyed, that is: 
    \begin{equation}
        \det(I-N\Delta(j\omega))=0, \forall \omega
    \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
In particular, at the end of the day:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the smallest uncertainty is less than one, then the robust stability/robust performance is \textbf{not fulfilled} since the stability is broken for an allowed value of $\Delta$. In other words given our uncertain plant there are some values of the allowed uncertainty for which the robust requirement is 'broken'.
    \item If the smallest uncertainty is greater or equal than one, RS/RP is fulfilled, since such an uncertainty does not belong to the set of the allowed uncertainty.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Such aspects can be better formalized by introducing $k_m$ being the \underline{singulatity margin} and the definition of a novel tool which will provide us with the possibility to check in an effective way RS/RP. This leads to the definition of the \textbf{structured singular value $\mu$}, that for the structure $N$, namely, is defined as:

\begin{equation}
    \mu(N,j\omega)=\frac{1}{\min\{k_m\in\mathbb{R}: \ \det(I-N(j\omega)\Delta(j\omega))=0, \ \Vert \Delta \Vert_\infty < 1\}}
\end{equation}
Note that $\mu(N,j\omega)$ is a real non-negative function of $\omega$. 

\section{$\mu$-analysis}
We are are ready for give necessary and sufficient conditions for robust stability and robust performance in terms of $\mu$. Performing the \textbf{$\mu$-analysis} is the same to say that we are using the structured singular values in order to check Robust Stability/Robust Performance.

\begin{multicols}{2}
    \noindent\textsf{\textbf{ ROBUST STABILITY}}\\
    Assume that $G_c$ stabilizes $N$, the $N-\Delta$ structure is robustly stable if and only if
    \begin{equation}
        \mu(N_{11}, j\omega) < 1 \quad \forall \omega 
    \end{equation}
    
    \newcolumn
    \noindent
    \textsf{\textbf{ROBUST PERFORMANCE}}\\
    Assume that $G_c$ stabilizes $N$ (provides internal stability), the following conditions are equivalent: 
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep-0.3em
        \item $\Vert F(s,\Delta) \Vert_\infty < 1, \quad \Vert \Delta \Vert_\infty<1$
        \item $\mu(N,j\omega)<1 \quad \forall \omega$ 
    \end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

\subsection{$\mu_{ub}$, $\mu_{lb}$: bounds on the true $\mu$}
The results we have just given are very nice, except for the fact that computing the structured singular value is an hard non-convex problem, this is the reason why, practically speaking only some numerical upper and lower bounds $\mu_{ub}, \ \mu_{lb}$ on the real $\mu$ can be computed.\\
Since, mostly we are not going to compute the real value for $\mu$, you can imagine that the conditions on the \textit{bounds of the true $\mu$} are no more necessary and sufficient. In particular:

\subsection{Sufficient conditions for robustness}
\begin{align}
    &\sup_\omega \mu_{ub}(N_{11},\omega) < 1 \ \Longrightarrow \textsf{Robust stability}\\
    & \sup_\omega \mu_{ub}(N,\omega) < 1 \ \Longrightarrow \textsf{Robust performance}
\end{align}
This says us that if $\mu_{up}$ is less than one, RS/RP requirement is fulfilled, on the contrary if $\mu_{up}>1$ and $\mu_{lb}<1$ nothing can be said since the true $\mu$ might be greater than one, but also less than one.

\subsection{Necessary conditions for robustness}
\begin{align}
    &\textsf{Robust stability} \ \Longrightarrow  \sup_\omega \mu_{lb}(N_{11},\omega) < 1\\
    &  \textsf{Robust performance} \ \Longrightarrow \sup_\omega \mu_{lb}(N,\omega) < 1 
\end{align}
Note that if $\mu_{lb} > 1$, then RS/RP are not fulfilled since the condition on the lower bound is a necessary one.
