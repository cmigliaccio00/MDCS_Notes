##### A) Weighting functions design $W_S^{-1}(j\omega)$, $W_T^{-1}(j\omega)$, $W_u^{-1}(j\omega)$. 

In the framework of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ robust control is of paramount importance the role of weighting functions expressing constraints on the sensitivity function and closed loop transfer function of the controlled system. The uncertainty and the related weighting function are discussed in such notes.

##### B) Unstructured model sets (sketchs of the proofs)
